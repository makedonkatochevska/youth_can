## Project Description 📜

**Youth Can** is a landing page designed to promote a youth empowerment initiative. The site provides a clear, engaging introduction to the platform’s goals, featuring different. This project focuses on delivering a clean, professional, and fully responsive design, ensuring an optimal experience across all devices.

## Project Purpose 📖

The purpose of **Youth Can** is to create an engaging and professional landing page to showcase the skills I’ve learned during the first third of my front-end academy at **Brainster**. This project not only aims to promote a youth empowerment initiative but also serves as a demonstration of my ability to implement responsive design, form validation, and interactive features using modern web technologies like **Sass**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **Bootstrap**. It was built to display my growth as a front-end developer and put into practice the knowledge gained so far in the program.

## Features ✨

- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts perfectly to any screen size, ensuring it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- 🖌️ **Element Animations**: Animations are applied to elements as they are scrolled into view, enhancing the user experience.(the animation-timeline property is supported only on Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave Browser, Chrome(for Android), Samsung Internet, Opera(mobile) and Android Browser, so if you're viewing the site from another browser, you won't see the animations)
- 📚 **Testimonial Carousel**: A dynamic carousel displaying testimonials from users made with **Bootstrap**.
- 📝 **Form Validation**: Simple and effective form validation using **JavaScript** for user input.
- 🛠️ **Sass and Bootstrap**: Used **Sass** for efficient styling and organized code and **Bootstrap** for carousel implementation.
- 🌍 **Fully Accessible**: Ensuring the landing page is accessible and user-friendly across various devices and browsers.

## Development Process 💻

- **Git Workflow**:

  - I created a new repository for this project and set up the basic structure.
  - For each section and feature (like the testimonial carousel, form validation, and animations), I created a separate branch, allowing me to work on them independently.
  - Once each feature was complete and tested, I merged them into the `dev` branch.
  - After confirming everything was working, I merged the `dev` branch into the `main` branch for the final release.

- **Version Control with Git**:
  - I used **Git** for version control to manage the changes throughout the development process.
  - Frequent commits were made to track progress, and **GitLab** was used for hosting and collaboration.
